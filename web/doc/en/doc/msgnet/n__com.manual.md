Node: Manual Trigger
==



Manually triggering messages, this node is generally used for testing. You can click the trigger button on the left side of the node in the flow to trigger message output.

You can also simply set the output message format, mainly for the payload and topic of the message. If it is content from other messages, set it to head.

If only one rule is set and this rule only sets a constant for the payload. Then the corresponding input box will automatically appear in the panel, allowing you to input parameters and send trigger messages during flow running.
