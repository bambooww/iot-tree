Tags Event/Alert Trigger
==



When configuring parameters, this node will list all tags in the project that have event/alarm information configured. Just select the relevant tags that need to be monitored.

The node has three output points. The first one is when the tag triggers an event/alarm, it will generate a message output; The second one is to output when the event/alarm is released; The third one is relational table resource association, which must be used in conjunction with the DB table resource nodes included in the relational database module - to support automatic database table recording of events/alarms.
