### 3.1 Basic properties

All items have basic properties, as shown in the above figure. The basic properties include ID, name, title, coordinate position x, y, stack height Z-index. Locked or not.

The ID is automatically generated by the system, and the name must be unique in the UI editing area and meet the name naming qualification. The coordinate position is the coordinate of the upper left corner of this entity in the drawing area (Cartesian coordinate system).

As the stacking height of items, Z-index is similar to Z-index in CSS. The higher the value, the later the painting order. When an item overlaps with other items, the larger the display effect Z-index is, the more it is displayed on the following items.

If the locked property is set to yes, the item is locked in the drawing area. The mouse cannot drag this. And when the mouse selects multiple items in a rectangular area, the locked items will not be selected. However, you can make a single selection of the locked element by clicking the mouse. At this time, you can also modify or unlock the properties.




### 3.2 Base drawitems and properties

Basic primitives include polyline, polygon, circle, ellipse, arc, text, picture, pipe (not implemented), Bezier curve, etc. they all have their own properties and characteristics.

In the upper left corner of the drawing area, there is a basic item toolbar. Click one of the items to select. When the mouse cursor moves to the back area, it will become a cross. Click and move the left mouse button to start drawing the corresponding basic item. When you release the left key, the currently created item is selected by default. You can then make adjustments and attribute modifications
