/**
 * iottree summarizes all aspects of data to form a tree. 
 * Next, we need to do some on-site real-time processing of these data. 
 * Such as timing control, or control according to some trigger conditions. 
 * You can also format the project context data as needed and submit it to other systems.
 * 
 * These are supported by tasks
